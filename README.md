# XOR-Gate-implementation-Using-BJT
This project demonstrates the implementation of an XOR (Exclusive-OR) logic gate using Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs).  The circuit is designed using five PN2222 transistors along with resistors and biasing components to achieve the XOR logic functionality.  The XOR gate produces HIGH output (1) only when the two inputs are different.
